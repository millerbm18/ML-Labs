    "This dataset can be useful for various parties, including NBA teams, coaches, players, sports bettors, or anyone looking to better understand basketball statistics. In our exploration, we will be specifically looking at the application of this data for an NBA team General Manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to www.investopedia.com, of the 30 NBA teams \"a team is worth on average $2.12 billion\", and \"total revenue across the organization reached 8.76 billion in the 2018-2019 season.\" This makes the role of a GM extremely important, as they must manage a multi-billion dollar business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through analyzing thousands of NBA game data from this dataset, a GM could make better-informed decisions on what statistics are most impactful on the game, and use that information to draft players which have the strengths that they need to build their team. If a machine learning algorithm used this data set, the algorithm could show the managers of an NBA team where they can improve their team. This data would allow the team to draft players that have strengths in these areas of weakness. To ensure that this algorithm would be feasible, the accuracy would have to be 60.29% accurate. This percentage was used because this was the average win percentage of the teams that made the playoffs last year. To determine if the algorithm produces a correct result, the drafted player would have to increase the number of wins for a team that did not make the playoffs the year before, or ensure that the team stays in the playoffs if they did make the playoffs the year before."

    "The 2003 and 2022 seasons were probably when the data started and stopped being collected which explains their limited games but 2011 and 2020 are short for different reasons. In 2011 there was a lockout so there were not as many games played and in 2020 COVID-19 came to the United States and cut the season short. Both of these facts might make us want to focus on these seasons if there is a similar situation to them in the future or take them out of the data if there are outliers compared to the other seasons. In general, there does not seem to be outliers caused by these seasons, but there are some niche effects caused by them which we discuss more in section 3.2."

If the radii of two datapoints intersect then they are considered neighbors, and a connection is made in the graph.

Density is defined as higher when the $k$th nearest neighbor is close, and lower when the $k$th nearest neighbor is far.
